They're often of low quality, irrelevant to your niche, and could come from spammy websites that may hurt your SEO efforts.
Imagine getting links from websites that sell viagra or gambling sites while your business is about beauty products. It not only looks unnatural to search engines, but it also sends a wrong signal and can damage your website's reputation and ranking. 
One high-quality backlink costs not less than $250, and that's how much it costs to get a high-quality content published on top publications. If you find an agency offering 100 backlinks for $20 or less, kindly run away.`,
